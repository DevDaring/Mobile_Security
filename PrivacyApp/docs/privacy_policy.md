# Privacy Policy - Privacy Guard App

**Last Updated:** November 15, 2025

## Overview

Privacy Guard is designed with privacy as a core principle. This app helps you manage your digital privacy by monitoring app permissions and social media posts, providing intelligent nudges to prevent regrettable disclosures.

## Data Collection and Processing

### What We Collect

Privacy Guard collects and processes the following data **locally on your device**:

1. **App Permission Access Logs**
   - Which apps access sensitive permissions (location, camera, microphone, contacts, storage)
   - Frequency and timing of permission accesses
   - User preferences for marking apps as "safe"

2. **Social Media Data** (Only if you connect accounts)
   - Your own posts from connected Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube accounts
   - Post visibility settings, audience sizes, and metadata
   - No data from your friends, followers, or other users

3. **User Settings and Preferences**
   - Nudge frequency and delivery preferences
   - Quiet hours settings
   - Sensitivity thresholds

4. **Audit Logs**
   - Record of nudges shown and your responses
   - Permission changes made through the app
   - Settings modifications

### How We Process Your Data

- **All data processing happens locally on your device**
- We do NOT send your personal data to external servers
- We do NOT collect analytics or telemetry without explicit opt-in
- We do NOT share your data with third parties
- We do NOT use your data for advertising

### Data Storage

- All data is stored using React Native AsyncStorage on your device
- OAuth tokens for social media are stored securely using platform-specific secure storage (iOS Keychain / Android Keystore)
- You can delete all app data at any time through the app or device settings

## Your Rights

You have the right to:

1. **Access** - View all data the app has collected through the Audit History screen
2. **Export** - Download your audit log as a local file
3. **Delete** - Clear all app data at any time
4. **Control** - Customize all privacy settings and nudge preferences
5. **Disconnect** - Remove connected social media accounts anytime

## Social Media Integration

When you connect social media accounts:

- We use official OAuth 2.0 flows for authentication
- We only request the minimum necessary permissions (read your own posts)
- We never post on your behalf without explicit action
- You can disconnect accounts at any time
- Disconnecting removes all cached data from that platform

## Research and Academic Use

If you choose to participate in academic research:

- Participation is entirely optional and opt-in
- Data shared for research is anonymized and aggregated
- You can withdraw consent at any time
- Research use follows IRB (Institutional Review Board) guidelines

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy to reflect changes in the app. We will notify you of significant changes through the app interface.
